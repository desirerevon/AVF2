                <h3>Less obvious perks of using 'live' data resources include logins and payments. How could Twitter be used in these two scenarios?</h3>
                Logins create a sense of security for a user. Twitter already has the implementation of the login aspect, but I would have to say that with social networks its to easy to hack someone’s page that I would not trust including payment information within the application. However, maybe there could be a separate payment app that Twitter can make just for it’s users that could be more secure.

                <h3>Visit Programmableweb.com and search for JSON-P data sources. Why would we need JSON-P, specifically?</h3>
                Well first let’s get the difference out of the way for less confusion. JSON is the data format. JSON-P is the method wrapped around it that is used during parsing. When you are trying to pull data from another site such as Twitter and you are trying to pull specific data in order to cross browse and retrieve specific data from that page you need to use a callback function or method. If you call a JSON object without a function you will get plain data back. If you retrieve data from the same site you can use regular JSON. So if you want certain data you need to use the callback function to specify what you want returned.</p>
                <p>
                <h3>Based on the JSON-P search results: what data resource(s) do you think might pair well with which types of Native device features?</h3>
                Camera: Snap pictures of the users current location that would save to there specific profile
Geolocation: To search the location of a device (Pertains to my app)
Contact: Store Contacts that are utilizing this app

                <h3>Briefly describe some past 'lessons learned' regarding workflow as it relates to research, design, development, etc.</h3>
                The way I began my applications is brainstorming. It’s hard sometimes because I have a lot of ideas, but the design aspect would take me longer than the assignments. I find that if you sketch out your design and get settled on the functionality to have you will have a better chance of getting the app done. I find that when I just start to create my app without brainstorming I don’t like my idea or I want to change certain elements and then I get stuck on something that I can’t get to work.  You should always start on paper, create the foundation for your html and then work on the functionality.
