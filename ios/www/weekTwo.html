                <p>
                <h3>What are some of the ways that you could change your HTML on your Demo app to be more accessible? (Remember, you can use the Section tag with jQuery, for instance)</h3>
                Currently all my HTML pages are separated and have their own html page, but I would like to go back to when we first started learning HTML and combine all my code on one HTML page and use data-role= page and identify each with a separate id. I think having less pages to flip through makes things a lot less complicated especially when I am trying to validate my code.

                <h3>Visit a video service on the web (like YouTube) and search for "Screen Reader Demo" and "Mobile Screen Reader" - what are some of the common frustrations (or common support mechanisms) that you see among the examples that are given - how could you fix them (or use them)?
 </h3>
                    Some of the common frustrations using mobile and regular screen readers page layouts causing confusing screen reader feedback, conflict between screen reader and application, unlabeled forms, no alt text for pictures, misleading links, no accessibility to pdf;s and screen reader crashes. For starts this is why we always test our code in advanced to make sure that our code is Semantically correct. If the search engine understands our code then the screen reader should although it’s up to the developer to make sure that if they are developing utilizing a screen reader that they make sure to include text for labels and links. The screen reader will read the code as it is written and if there is no text describing a link it will return that link which gives the impaired no information about that link but frustrating them and wasting more of their time.</p>

                <h3>Devices: Please list two devices (and some of their features) that are made specifically to support Accessibility.
 ?</h3>
               The iphone provides many tools for accessibility. This would include screen readers and assistive touch. The Kindle is another device that was created for readers to download books. This is similar to a Nook or iPad, but not exactly. Amazon announced that they would be offering new features on the Kindle Fire 7-inch for the impaired such as a voice guide and explore by touch.  The voice guide will allow the user to say a title of a book and it will be typed and the explore by touch will announce a menu option and have the user choose the option while the second tap will perform the specific action.

                <h3>Mobile Apps: Please list two apps (either Android or iOS, or both) that are made specifically to support Accessibility.</h3>
               Access World is a free app for the blind that allows it’s user to search through magazines and articles and voice over reads the entire elements back to its user. Flesky is another app that is designed for the visually impaired. This allows the user to to press where the think a letter is and it will automatically type what they are looking for without looking at the device.</p>
